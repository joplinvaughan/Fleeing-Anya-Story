The New Society considered the rules they had created a safety net but all she saw was a leash, a gilded cage. The effort to take away
freedoms that those of the Old World had relished in. They claimed that those very freedoms had led to the rise of the seas, to the
destruction of a world only a few truly have memories of. And it was these rules that Anya raged against. Anya longed to dance in starlight,
and visit worlds she had only dreamed of. She longed to revel in true freedom, she only hoped that the path she had chosen was the 
right one.

She had left it all behind on whims and mere rumors...not that she had much to begin with. She had a life back there, where she had once
live, however little of it was actually hers, but it was a life. She had food, and shelter, and even a handful of people she could call
friends. That wasn't life she thought, that wasn't really living.
