# Fleeing-Anya-Story
Short story assignment 2

  Long after Washington, Oregon and California have succeeded the union and joined Canada. In fact most of those states are underwater.There is the New Union. In a dystopian world, after sea levels have risen. Nearly all the books have been burned. 

Anya is trying to find the rebels camp in a cave. She is traveling in the woods alone and she sees George Washingtons’ huge face, although to her it is merely another face. She most be close she thinks to herself. The map she had memorized had said deep in the woods where a mans face is carved from stone is where you will find us. She dredges on.

She looks up seeing something clouding her vision. Is it the first snowfall of the winter? No. Its larger, lighter. She thinks she sees something brighter. She rubs her already dry eyes. 

“Illusion” she mutters to herself she decides to justify  what she sees to starvation and lack of water from the last several days. She trenches onward but something on the ground stops her. As she bends over to reach she realizes it wasn’t an illusion at all. But a torn piece of paper slightly burned on the edges. In the middle of the page is a majestic explosion of reds, blues and purples. She has never seen anything so beautiful. 
  
“Fireworks” she whisper reads from the paper. She cocks her head to the side and squints her eyes from confusion. It gets shoved in her pocket with other treasures.
